# SODS
A simple library for and process ODS files in Java.

# What is an ODS?
ODS means Open Document Spreadsheet. It's used in applications like Libreoffice or Open Office.

# What is the motivation of this?
I needed to generate ODS files in Java. I looked for libraries, but they are:

- Deprecated or dead, like Apache ODF Toolkit. It's not working with Java 8.
- It has Libre Office as dependency in the user's computer. That's so much (Libre Office Api).
- Poorly designed or bloated, like jopendocument. I really had bad time with this library.

So, i decided create my own library from scratch. Everything is possible!

# What is the current state?
It's not ready yet. Contributions are welcome!
